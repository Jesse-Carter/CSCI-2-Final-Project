# CSCI-2-Final-Project
My final project for CSCI 1010, a lightly encrypted instant messaging application in Java
It is composed of 7 different classes
To operate the program, place all files in a package called CS2FinalProject
Execute the ServerTest.java application
You must then look up your ip address
Once you have your ip address, open Client11.java and insert your ip address in the client constructor
Execute the file
You have now connected and are able to communicate, make sure your encryption key is the other users decryption key and vice versa!
Messages can only be sent through the text box above the send botton and then pressing the send botton
